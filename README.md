# Mandelbrot-Fractal-Animation
- Fractals have their existence in almost everything: leaves in a tree, veins in a hand, etc. They have numerous applications in the field of astronomy, computer science (fractal image compression), telecommunications (fractal-shaped antenna) and surface physics to name a few.
- The aim of this project is to use core C++ for generating such fractals.
- In this project, a Mandelbrot fractal image is generated each time with different coefficient values, to create appropriate zooming and panning to ensure smooth transition of images in the animation.
- The result is, a series of .ppm image files, all of which can be converted to .jpg and further combined using any video maker to form an animation.
- This simple project shows how mathematical equations with minor adjustments in the coefficient values, combined with any coding language can generate visually appealing images.
